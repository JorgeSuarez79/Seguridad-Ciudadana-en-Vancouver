Introduction:
Citizen security
What is sought in this project is to find a safe places for citizenship in Vancouver, Canada. Thus, this report will allow knowing where most crimes are carried out and the safest suburbs to transit in the city of Vancouver, Canada.

To start, the ideal is to discover the safest district by reviewing crime data and making a list of the least criminal neighborhoods where people can travel more safely and safely.

With the tools used during the data science courses we will analyze and focus on the safest district and get to know its neighborhoods and the most common ones
Where the people or the citizen can move quietly.

Data

We can identify the elements that will affect the decision to discover the safest places to travel:
• Choose the correct neighborhood within the municipality
• Find the safest district
• Find the most common places
• We will review the geographic coordinates of Vancouver to find neighborhoods in a district that are safe to present.

The following data sources will be needed to extract / generate the required information:
We will need the following data sources:

Stage One: Use of Kaggle data containing 2016 Vancouver crimes where crime records are found in each Vancouver neighborhood along with their characteristics.

Second Stage: Information will be obtained from Wikipedia to cross it with the base of the first stage and thus be able to correctly identify each neighborhood to which municipality it belongs.

Third Stage: Using OpenCage Geocoder a new dataframe of the neighborhoods will be made, as well as the crime data and their coordinates, to find the safest places for citizens. It will be crossed in maps using Folium and a deeper analysis can be determined based on what was found.

Last Stage: Using the Four Square API a new set of neighborhoods, districts will be made to group them and show the new discoveries using Folium maps.
